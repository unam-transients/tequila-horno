# Aperture Photometry

## Aperture Centers

I find stars in the mean images. 
However, the individual 00, 01, 10, and 11 images are displaced by half a pixel in each direction from the mean images.
To compensate for this, when I do aperture photometry in the individual images, I should offset the centers of the apertures to account for these displacements.
